        <p>Hello, My name is Kevin Nguyen. I've achieved my associates degree before deciding to drop out and pursue
            real estate. I have several years in the customer service industry and have always had an interest in real estate
            so I decided, why not gain experience now by becoming a real estate agent. Throughout my career as an agent, I plan
            on gaining all the knowledge in order to become a future investor in real estate. Currently though, I do not have
            a steady enough income to live comfortably so I've decided to take on another career in the programming industry.
            I've struggled with coding in college but I am trying again fresh and hoping to do good enough to obtain a steady
            income job in the programming industry. This is my story for now and I hope to be successful in all aspects of my life.
        </p>
